## Chamber Directory Page (Week 2 Assignment)

The `chamber` sub-folder contains the Chamber of Commerce project started in week 2. The `directory.html` page lists chamber members fetched from a local JSON file and allows users to switch between a grid and list view. All assets for the chamber site live inside the `chamber` directory to keep it independent from other coursework.
